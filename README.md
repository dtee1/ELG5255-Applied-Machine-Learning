# ELG5255-Applied-Machine-Learning
Coped from course outline - "This course aims at teaching the theory and applications of machine learning by using techniques that utilize statistics, neural computation and information theory. More specifically theory of machine learning will include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, Bayesian estimation, multivariate, parametric and non-parametric methods, dimensionality reduction, decision tree , ensemble learning, multilayer perceptron networks and deep neural networks. The applied content of the course will teach designing and testing machine intelligence techniques on real-world problems. Students will be introduced the guidelines for machine learning experiments, methods for cross-validation and resampling, classifier performance analysis and tools for comparing classification algorithms and analysis of variance to compare multiple algorithms.
